# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## npm install react-router-dom
we need to install React Router DOM by running npm install react-router-dom in our terminal.
This command will install the React Router DOM package and its dependencies in our project. After installation, we can use React Router DOM to handle routing and navigation in our React applications.

## npm install axios

We need to install Axios, a library for making HTTP requests, by running npm install axios in our terminal.
This command will install the Axios package and its dependencies in our project. After installation, we can use Axios to make HTTP requests in our JavaScript applications.

## npm install json-server
we need to install JSON Server, a tool to mock REST APIs quickly, by running npm install json-server in our terminal.
This command will install JSON Server globally on our system, allowing us to use it from anywhere in our command line interface. After installation, we can start using JSON Server to serve our JSON data as a RESTful API.

## npx json-server Backend data/db.json --watch --port 6000 /
## npx json-server Data/data.json --watch --port 7000
In a React login form, two backend databases are used: one hosted on port 6000, containing data from data/db.json, and another hosted on port 7000, containing data from Data/data.json.
